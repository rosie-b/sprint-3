What is you site's primary purpose?
A blog tracking my EDA experience, reflections and progress from knowing little-to-nothing about web development to knowing a-little-bit. Also, the starting point for my dev portfolio.

Who is your target audience?
Anyone who may be interested in following my journey and seeing the improvements I make as I learn along the way. 

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want my site to be really user friendly, no matter the device or screen size. And to be visually quite simple, but appealing to the eye. I want to put some fun features on there, maybe a few easter eggs for people to find.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
May use an existing framework with additional custom CSS. Responsive design is going to be important. And trying to keep the code nice and clean, so that I can more easily make adjustments and pop in fun features. White space and simple color pallet to keep it simple.
